# NG-Volleyball-Ladder-Repo
CS 490 Capstone Project

Volley-Ladder project

Overview:
Northrop Grumman has a very competitive volleyball community that regularly competes and
wins in city leagues in the SLC area. However not everyone wants to play at that level of
commitment and skill, therefore we have created a company volleyball ladder system. At a
large scale, team management, court scheduling, and matchmaking is be pretty tedious and
error-prone if done manually. So the company club is looking for an application that can help
automate and organize our events. Your work will be used or around 1000 employees and can
affect up to 23,000 employes.

What:
An app to manage a volleyball ladder system.
This project will cover areas such as UI development, database management, networking, agile
practices, and version control. There will be a high emphasis planning and execution using
agile practices. Since this effort will focus on transferable software development skills, the
participants can choose the tools used as long as it’s done in a timely manner and the tools our
requirements. The product will eventually be open source for the public to use so you’re able to
build-up your personal GitHub to aid you in future interviews.
