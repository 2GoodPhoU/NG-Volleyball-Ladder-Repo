# NG-Volleyball-Ladder-Repo
CS 490 Capstone Project

Volley-Ladder project

Overview:
Northrop Grumman has a very competitive volleyball community that regularly competes and
wins in city leagues in the SLC area. However not everyone wants to play at that level of
commitment and skill, therefore we have created a company volleyball ladder system. At a
large scale, team management, court scheduling, and matchmaking is be pretty tedious and

agile practices. Since this effort will focus on transferable software development skills, the
participants can choose the tools used as long as it’s done in a timely manner and the tools our

build-up your personal GitHub to aid you in future interviews.
